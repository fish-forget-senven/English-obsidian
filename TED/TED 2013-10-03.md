We've all seen movies about terrible insects from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men, but the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, is also a serious, scientific pursuit. 
我们时常在电影里看到从外太空来的可怕的昆虫或者地球人被小绿人绑架的故事，但是有关宇宙生物的研究包括外星生物存在的可能性却是一门严肃的科学研究。

Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology, to study how life was formed on Earth, how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it. 
天体生物学集合了物理学、生物学、天文学以及地质学的知识来研究生命是怎样在地球上形成的，它如何能在地球以外的地方形成以及我们怎样才能探知地外生命。

Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings, but these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes than other planets existing in the same physical world. 
很多古老的宗教都描述过人类居住的另外的世界但这些都属于神话，或者是平行宇宙的范围，与其它存在于我们这个物理世界的行星无关。

It is only within the last century that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life. We know that at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things: liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based material. 
从上个世纪开始科学家们才有能力真正地着手有关地外生命的研究，我知道地球上最基本的生物需要三种物质：液态水、能量源以及有机碳化物。

We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun, so as not to be either frozen or molten. So, planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life. 
我们也知道地球与太阳之间的距离刚好以至于我们不会被冰封，也不会被融化，所以，与恒星保持适当距离的行星应该有孕育生命的可能性。

But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments, one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is. 
我们曾经以为生命只能存在于类似地球的环境下，但是，天体生物学的最惊人的发现之一让我们知道了生命形式的多样性。

[01:22](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=82.698732)

We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments that'd be fatal for most known organisms. Life is found everywhere, from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans, to bubbling, hot, acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes, to high up in the atmosphere. 
我们现在知道生命可以在一些极其严酷的环境中成长，而这些环境对大多数已知生物来说都是致命的。到处都可以找到生命的迹象，从地球深海热泉的黑烟到火山侧翼滚烫的酸性温泉再到大气的高层。

[01:40](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=100.486491)

Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles, and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation, as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen. 
生长于这些环境中的生物被叫做嗜极生物，它们可以存活于极端的温度、压力、辐射、盐度、酸度以及有限的阳光水分或氧气。

[01:55](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=115.874488)

What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds. One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars. 
这些嗜极生物最引人注目的是适合它们生长的环境往往与外星环境相似，最重要的地外行星之一是我们布满尘土的邻居，火星。

Today, astrobiologists are exploring places where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's Curiosity rover. One of these is Gale Crater, an impact crater created when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions years ago. Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water, which means the crater might once have supported life. 
目前，天体生物学家们正在利用美国宇航局（NASA）的好奇号（Curiosity）火星探测器来勘探火星上可能存在过生命的地方。其中一处便是盖尔撞击坑，它是于将近38亿年前彗星撞击火星表面造成的。我们从彗星轨道上发现有少量水分的迹象说明撞击坑可能曾经有过生命存在。

[02:31](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=151.045395)

Planets are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at. For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons, are all exciting possibilities. 
而天体生物学家们不仅仅关注地外行星，它们也关注其它有可能存在生命的地方。包括木星的卫星之一，木卫二以及土星的两个卫星土卫二和土卫六。

[02:42](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=162.451151)

Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in thick ice, there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell. Could life be floating around in these oceans, or could it be living around black smoker vents at the bottom? 
虽然这些卫星都极其寒冷，其中两个还被厚冰覆盖，有证据表明它们的外壳下面存在液态海洋。生命有可能浮游在这些海洋中吗？或是生存于深海热泉的黑烟中？或是生存于深海热泉的黑烟中？

[02:56](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=176.808559)

Titan is particularly promising as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface. It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water, so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. 
土卫六是很有希望的，因为它拥有大气层并且其表面上分布着类似地球的湖泊，海洋，河流。但是，它非常寒冷以至没有液态水存在所以土卫六的河流中流动的应该是液态的碳氢化合物，例如，甲烷和乙烷这些物质。

[03:13](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gf4y1y7wc?p=2#t=193.079166)

These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly, carbon, which is the basic building block of all life as we know it. So, could life be found in these lakes? Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds, it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be. 
由氢和碳构成而碳元素则是所有已知生命的基础组成部分那么，我们有可能在这些湖泊中发现生命吗？虽然科学家们已经着手设计用于探测遥远星球的仪器，但是制造这些仪器需要许多年，而把它们送到外星则需要更长时间。

In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth, to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?
在此期间，天体生物学家们将利用我们的天然实验室，地球来了解可能存在的各种奇特的生命形式从而帮助我们回答人类有史以来最古老的问题之一：我们是孤独的吗？
